            Cover Letter
          </h2>
          <p>
            When I was a little, I would peel off the labels from shampoo bottles. Those labels served a purpose -as I my annoyed dad, pointed out; they let you tell shampoo and body gel apart-, but I found them confusing, packed with irrelevant information repeated in spanish and portuguese and were, in any case, very ugly. And relevance is always relative to the intended audience. Those bottles bomb users with information that is actually meant for the buyer. I, as a user, needed no more than a word on that label. A symbol, a single letter, maybe even a color, had we agreed to a color code - which we didn’t.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a knack for communication relevancy. I find excess very annoying -and kind of tacky-. Digital users tend to agree with me: too much information, too many options, even too much blank space are every day harder to swallow. The best user experience is the one tailored to the audience at hand: this means users get to unravel your storytelling how and when they choose. In other words; the bottle has the information, but you can access it on your own terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m a passionate designer and I think it takes understanding to perform the best design. It’s the only way to figure out why the user is peeling off your label.

                I soon realized I needed to get into team dynamics, complex productcs... I needed a bigger job to learn the specifics of user experience. At BinPar, I learned to be a part of a multidisciplinary development taskforce. I became an independent front-end designer, shaping projects in environments such as ReactJS, through HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript and working together with different profiles in order to achieve experiences the user might find helpful.

              <p>
                I decided to go freelance so I could learn what I considered to be the most complete form of communication for a brand: UX design and all that it entails. Art Direction and UX design happen to be very similar; only the latter gave me a freedom in building experiences. And of course, I hung on to that permanently. As a freelance I took care of UX and UI Design, defining complete storytellings for my clients’ brands. Soon enough, the end-user journey and its pace became much more important to me than the specific colors, fonts and images.

                Fresh out of college, I started as an Advertising Art Director. I attended to my clients’ both communicational and art needs, coming up with storytelling solutions that I would generally execute myself in form of copies, artworks, even guidelines.
