          <h2>APSIS</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>APSIS MDM</strong> is a data gobernance company with very specific needs. Their employees have to make dozens of calls a day, and they need to make the process of updating data swifter and in a more controlled environment.
          </p>

          <h3>UX Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            To me, the most obvious reason for slow results was, in this case, <strong>employee misinformation</strong>. The operators know they need to complete a series of calls and update as much information as possible. But they don't have a real sense of how much of that update has been truly completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Senior employers will look over a certain database and determine whether or not it is right, and <strong>there is no follow-up</strong>: it simply goes back in the pool of profiles that need to be updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Many calls could be optimized</strong> if the operators knew the company they are calling might be related to other profiles that need to bee updated, or if they had access to the profile call log, etc. Also, not every operator has access to editing every field of the data base, but often finds out about a field that is wrong, or empty, and could signify it, but has no way or time.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In short, the main two problems are <strong>operator self-management</strong> and keeping <strong>all related information at hand and editable</strong> during the call.
          </p>

          <h3>UX Solutions</h3>
          <p>
            We came up with a <strong>dashboard for the operator</strong> that opens up with a percentage of finished calls, a percentage of quality and a preview of tasks. Quality comes from senior employees checking the quality of the operators' edited fields. The finished calls are only those in which a update of all the required fields has taken place: if no-one picked up, the call isn't finished, so it's still in the operator's to-do list. These two indicators are meant to make the operator aware of his progress and want to do better.
          </p>
          <p>
            The juicy part of this project, however is the <strong>call interface</strong>. We determined that all information related should be present. If we are calling about a company's CTO, we are going to see the company's information, all the contacts related to that company -employees and former employees-, the call log of this specific contact, the usual call form, etc.
          </p>
          <img src="./img/apsis-deploy-data.jpg" alt="AXON first draft" width="700" class="article-img">
          <p>
            The operator has to be able to see that the information is there, but also able to flag a field if the conversation conveys the information is wrong. He also might need to cease the contact on the spot and make a new one -there might be a new CTO, for example-.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            All the information flagged will appear in the task list of a superior employee, or someone with editing permissions for that specific field.
